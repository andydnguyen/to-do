# To-Do-List Using JavaScript
the to-do list we're going to create has a beautiful UI, the user can add a to-do by filling the input and hit ENTER, after the user can rather check the to-do when it's done, or remove it using the delete button.

The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when the page refreshes the list will remain there.

There is the possibility for the user, to clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of the app.

The to do list app, shows the today's date to the user, for that we're using a method called toLocaleDateString, which you can read about here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString
